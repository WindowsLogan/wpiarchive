## About

This repository hosts a **Windows Phone–styled (Metro UI)** static website for archiving multiple versions of WPInternals.

The goal of this project is to preserve older and preview releases in a clean, accessible, and platform-faithful format.

The website is designed to resemble the classic Windows Phone 8 aesthetic:
- Segoe UI typography  
- Flat tile interface  
- Windows accent colours  
- Minimal, clean layout
